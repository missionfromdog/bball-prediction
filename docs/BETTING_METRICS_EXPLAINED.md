# Betting Metrics Explained - User Guide

## Understanding Your Betting Analysis Results

When you see betting metrics for a game, here's what each one means and how to use it:

---

## 📊 Edge: +8.2%

**What it means:**
- This is the difference between your model's prediction and the bookmaker's "fair" probability (after removing the house edge).
- **+8.2%** means your model thinks the team has an **8.2 percentage points higher** chance of winning than what the bookmaker's odds suggest.

**In plain English:**
- Your model: "This team has a 68.2% chance to win"
- Bookmaker (fair odds): "This team has a 60% chance to win"
- **Edge = 68.2% - 60% = +8.2%**

**How to use it:**
- ✅ **Positive edge** (green): Your model sees value - the bookmaker is underestimating this team
- ⚠️ **Small edge** (0-5%): Marginal value, proceed with caution
- ✅ **Large edge** (>5%): Strong value bet opportunity
- ❌ **Negative edge**: Bookmaker's odds are better than your model - avoid this bet

**Your example (+8.2%):**
This is a **strong positive edge** - your model significantly disagrees with the bookmaker in your favor. This is a good sign!

## 💰 EV (Expected Value): $0.11

**What it means:**
- This is how much money you expect to **profit per $1 bet** if you make this bet many times.
- **$0.11** means for every $1 you bet, you expect to make **11 cents profit** on average over the long run.

**In plain English:**
- If you bet $1 on this game 100 times, you'd expect to make about **$11 profit** total (after accounting for wins and losses)
- This is a **positive EV bet** - it's profitable in the long run

**How to use it:**
- ✅ **Positive EV** (green): Profitable bet - make this bet
- ❌ **Negative EV** (red): Losing bet - avoid this bet
- The higher the EV, the more profitable the bet

**Your example ($0.11):**
This is a **positive EV bet** - you expect to make money over time. Not huge, but consistently positive EV bets add up!

**Real-world example:**
- Bet $100 on this game → Expect to make $11 profit on average
- Bet $1,000 on this game → Expect to make $110 profit on average
- (Note: This is long-term average - individual results will vary)

## 🎯 Kelly: 12.5%

**What it means:**
- This is the **optimal percentage of your bankroll** you should bet on this game, according to the Kelly Criterion formula.
- **12.5%** means you should bet **12.5% of your total bankroll** on this game.

**In plain English:**
- If your bankroll is $500, bet 12.5% = **$62.50** on this game
- The Kelly Criterion maximizes your long-term growth while protecting your bankroll

**How to use it:**
- ✅ **0-10%**: Conservative bet size - safe and recommended
- ⚠️ **10-20%**: Moderate bet size - still reasonable
- ⚠️ **20-25%**: Aggressive bet size - higher risk
- ❌ **0% or negative**: Don't bet - no value or negative EV

**Your example (12.5%):**
This is a **moderate bet size** - not too conservative, not too aggressive. It's a good balance between growth and risk management.

**Why Kelly matters:**
- Betting too much: Risk of ruin (losing your bankroll)
- Betting too little: Missing out on growth
- Kelly finds the "sweet spot" that maximizes long-term profits

## 💵 Bet: $62.53

**What it means:**
- This is the **recommended bet amount in dollars** based on your bankroll and the Kelly percentage.
- **$62.53** is how much you should bet on this game.

**In plain English:**
- This is calculated as: **Kelly % × Your Bankroll = Bet Amount**
- Example: 12.5% × $500.24 = $62.53

**How to use it:**
- This is the **exact dollar amount** to bet on this game
- Adjust your bankroll in the sidebar to change this amount
- Only bet this amount if you're comfortable with the risk

**Your example ($62.53):**
Based on your current bankroll setting, this is the recommended bet size. If you change your bankroll, this number will update automatically.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Focus on Value Bets**: Only bet when you have a positive edge and positive EV
2. **Use Kelly Sizing**: Don't bet more than Kelly recommends - it's mathematically optimal
3. **Bankroll Management**: Never bet more than you can afford to lose
4. **Long-Term Thinking**: EV is about long-term averages - individual games will win or lose
5. **Combine Metrics**: Use all metrics together - Edge + EV + Kelly for best decisions

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is my bet size so high/low?**
A: Bet size depends on your bankroll and the Kelly percentage. Increase/decrease your bankroll in the sidebar to adjust.

**Q: What if Kelly says to bet 25% but that's too much?**
A: Kelly is capped at 25% for safety. If that's still too much, you can manually bet less, but you'll be leaving some value on the table.

**Q: Can I bet more than Kelly recommends?**
A: Not recommended. Kelly is mathematically optimal - betting more increases risk without improving long-term returns.

**Q: What if EV is positive but edge is negative?**
A: This shouldn't happen mathematically. If it does, there may be an error in the calculations.

**Q: How often will I win with positive EV bets?**
A: You won't win every time! EV is about long-term averages. A +$0.11 EV bet might lose 3 times in a row, but over 100 bets, you'll be profitable.
